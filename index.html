					<b>Evidence of prehistoric settlement in the area of Killarney dates back to at least 4,000 years ago. Copper mining began at Ross Island at the dawn of the Bronze Age (c.2400-1800 BC) and these mines are now recognised as the oldest in north western Europe.

						In the lowlands to the north and east of the National Park, there are a number of other prehistoric features of archaeological interest. These include the Lissyviggeen Stone Circle, dating from the Bronze Age, as well as standing stones, fulachta fiadh (cooking sites), and traces of ring forts dating from the Iron Age and early Christian times. Monastic sites provide the main evidence of the history and occupation of the Killarney area in early Christian times. The most significant of these was the monastery on Innisfallen Island, part of the National Park, by St Fionán in the 7th century. The “Annals of Innisfallen” written there between the 11th and 13th centuries, provide a key source of information on the early history of Ireland. During the early Christian period, the Killarney area were ruled by the Kings of Eoganacht Locha Léin who took their name from Lough Leane at the heart of their territory. Following the Norman invasion, the McCarthys, Kings of South Munster, retreated to South Kerry and West Cork, where they displaced the local chieftains. The Normans made several unsuccessful attempts to take control of this area in the 13th Century.

									<p>History of Killarney Killarney (Irish: Cill Airne, meaning “church of sloes”) is a town in County Kerry, southwestern Ireland.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The town is on the northeastern shore of Lough Leane, which is part of Killarney National Park. The town and its hinterland is home to St Mary’s Cathedral, Ross Castle, Muckross House and Abbey, the Lakes of Killarney, MacGillycuddy’s Reeks, Purple Mountain, Mangerton Mountain, the Gap of Dunloe and Torc Waterfall. Owing to its natural heritage, history and its location on the Ring of Kerry, Killarney is a popular tourist destination. 

										Killarney has featured prominently in early Irish history, with religious settlements playing an important part of its recorded history. Its first significantly historical settlement was the monastery on nearby Innisfallen Island founded in 640 by St. Finian the Leper, which was occupied for approximately 850 years.
										Following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland in 1169, the Normans built Parkavonear Castle, also at Aghadoe. The castle was perhaps intended as an early warning outpost due to its views of the entire Killarney valley and lakes region.The first written record of a monastery dates from 939 AD in the Annals of Innisfallen where the Aghadoe monastery is referred to as the “Old Abbey.Aghadoe, the local townland which overlooks present day Killarney, may have begun as a pagan religious site. The site has also been associated with the 5th century missionary St. Abban, but 7th century ogham stones mark the first clear evidence of Aghadoe being used as an important site. According to legend, St. Finian founded a monastery at Aghadoe in the 6th or 7th century.</span></p>

									<h2>Ross Castle</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Ross Castle, built on the shores of Lough Leane, is a fine example of a 15th Century stone tower house. It was home to the Chieftan O’Donoghue Mór and the castle was one of the last Gaelic strongholds<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> in Ireland. Control and ownership of the castle was contested throughout the 17th and early 18th Centuries by the Gaelic Irish, Cromwellian forces, Jacobite and Williamite supporters. A garrison of troops were billeted at the barracks attached to the castle during the 17th and 18th Centuries. Ross Castle was ultimately the property of the Browne’s until 1956 and this historic structure was generously donated to the Republic of Ireland by John and Mary McShain in 1970. It has been open to the public since it’s restoration in 1990. The castle contains historic period oak furniture from the 16th and 17th Centuries. The castle is located at the edge of Lough Leane and can be accessed by walking and cycling routes within the National Park. Ross Castle is a National Monument and is maintained by the Office of Public Works. </span></p>

									<h2>Muckross House and Gardens</h2>
								</header>
								<p>This residence was built by Thomas Herbert whose great grandson Henry Arthur Herbert subsequently built the present Muckross House,pictured right, in 1843.<span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4"> Throughout their tenure at Muckross, the Herberts played a very active role in social and political life and in the development and improvement of the Muckross Estate. However, by the late 19th century a series of financial problems heralded the end of over 200 years of the Herbert family at Muckross. In 1899, the Muckross Estate, encompassing approximately 1,300 acres of demesne lands was sold to Lord Ardilaun, a member of the Guinness family. He then sold the property to a Californian, Mr. William Bowers Bourn in 1911, who gave the estate to his daughter Maud, on her marriage to Mr. Arthur Vincent. They carried out a number of developments to the estate over the following 20 years.

									The estate, comprising about 4,300 hectares, was given to the State in 1932 as the Bourn-Vincent Memorial Park, in memory of Maud who died in 1929. In 1964, a group of local people, concerned at the continued closure of Muckross House over 30 years after it had passed into State ownership, came together and formed the Trustees of Muckross House (Killarney) Limited. They approached the Minister for Finance, who had responsibility for Muckross House at that time, proposed that the House be opened to the public. This proposal was accepted and the successful partnership between the State and the Trustees of Muckross House has endured to the present day.</span></p>
